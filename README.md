Currently (17.04.2025) when you switch from Workflowy to another app, the Workflowy's window stays on top.

This utility app hides the app completely whenever you switch to another app.

Not the best solution for those who prefer to work with several apps windows present at screen at any given moment, but i believe it's better than the current behaviour with this Workflowy bug.

In order for the fix to work, just [download the app](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19788700/hide-workflowy.app.zip), open it and forget about this bug.
